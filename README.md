# EDA_&_Feature_Engineering
1. Exploratory Data Analysis on Zomato Dataset
This part of the project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Zomatoâ€™s restaurant dataset to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights.

Key Highlights:
Cleaned and preprocessed raw data (handled missing values, duplicates).

Analyzed country-wise usage, restaurant ratings, popular cuisines, and delivery types.

Visualized trends using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Identified business insights such as peak activity countries and rating distribution.

2. Feature Engineering on Flight Price Prediction
This section focuses on enhancing the dataset for better model performance in predicting flight ticket prices.

Key Highlights:
Extracted time-based features (e.g., journey day, month, duration in minutes).

Converted categorical columns using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.

Performed outlier detection and removal.

3. Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Scikit-learn
